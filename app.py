- Construction date (current building, previous buildings if applicable)
- List of tenants which have occupied the subject property
- Permits of environmental concern (petroleum storage tanks, septic systems, oil/water separators)
- Oldest and most recent site layout plan from the above mentioned property if available
- Erosion control plans on record for the subject property
- Record violations or complaints registered against the subject property

(1) to reduce or eliminate potential exposure to hazardous substances or petroleum products in the soil, soil vapor, groundwater, and/or surface water on the property, or (2) to prevent activities that could interfere with the effectiveness of a response action, in order to ensure maintenance of a condition of no significance risk to public health or the environment. These legal or physical restrictions, which may include institutional and/or engineering controls, are intended to prevent adverse impacts to individuals or populations that may be exposed to hazardous substances and petroleum products in the soil, soil vapor, groundwater, and/or surface water on a property. AULs are typically in place at sites which would prevent future uses of a property.
- Subject property zoning and any current zoning violations.
